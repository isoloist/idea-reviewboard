[Review Board](http://www.review-board.org/) is an open source web-based code review tool written by VMware developers.  This project will let you submit code reviews from the "commit" dialog of [IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and maybe do further interactions in the future (show a list of your pending reviews, etc.).

I don't have a ton of time to work on this, but I'm just putting it out there for now.
